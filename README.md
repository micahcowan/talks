# PDXSH Talks

This is a repo for talk proposals and related assets (slide decks, code samples, etc) for the [Portland Shell Hackers](http://www.meetup.com/pdx-sh/) meetup.

To submit a talk, have a look a the [proposals/ folder](https://github.com/pdxsh/talks/blob/master/proposals)'s [README](https://github.com/pdxsh/talks/blob/master/proposals/README.md).

Please also take the time to read over our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pdxsh/talks/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)

Thanks, 
The PDXSH Crew
